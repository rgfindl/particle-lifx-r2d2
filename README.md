# particle-lifx-r2d2

IoT project to build R2D2.  When one of my kids wants to know the temperature and how to dress weather appropriate.  All they have to do is use the force, by waving their hands, and R2D2 will connect to the particle.io cloud to fetch the temperature.  R2D2 will then beeb, flash LEDs, display the temperature on an LCD display, and then turn on a LIFX light bulb.  The LIFX light bulb will be either blue, yellow, or red depending on the temperature outside.
